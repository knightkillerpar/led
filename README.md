# code library

## LED.ino

------------------

*in the first line we included our led library that we have to bring it in "".
in line 3 we define the pin of the LED that we have.
in line 5 we use our led library and make an led of our library and we chose our number pin in it.
in part 7 to 10 in the set up void we use led.init();
int void loop part we call our functios such as led blink and we write the number of the delay that wer one to have.
and the led time dance.*

------------------

## LED.h

------------------

*we put our maincode at #ifndef up to #endif and in #ifndef we wrote ourlibrary name that it chose our code names to.
in the second line we define out library name and afther that we include Arduino library.
Afther that we use class to wrote our main code for our library.
class has to part:
1-private
1-public
in private part just we have to wrote every thing that have m at first and just we have to wrote the name of our led pin in that part.
in public part we put the led pin in our LED.
afther that we wrote all of our functions.

------------------

## LED.cpp

*in the first line we include our library.
athere that we put our led number ate the function we made.
in led.init we outout the led.
and we wrote all of out function in secend parts.
TIP:we have to wrote our LED that we made insted of wroting the functions.
